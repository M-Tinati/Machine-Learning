# Simple Linear Regression Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict a target variable based on a single feature. The goal is to demonstrate the basics of machine learning using linear regression, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `linear_regression.py`: Main script with the linear regression implementation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression.py
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a simple CSV file (e.g., `data/sample_data.csv`) with two columns:
- `feature`: The independent variable (input).
- `target`: The dependent variable (output).

Ensure your dataset is placed in the `data/` folder or update the file path in the script.

## Model Details
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Features**: Single feature for simplicity
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot with the regression line

## Results
The script outputs:
- Trained model parameters (slope and intercept)
- Performance metrics (MSE and R²)
- A plot showing the data points and the fitted regression line

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Any suggestions for enhancing the model or adding new features are welcome!
